	<h2>Introduction</h2><a name="Introduction"></a>
	<p>The average person spends about eight hours on the web per day. 
	The internet is a very big part of our daily life but most people don’t actually know what it is or how it works,
	and most of the time  the World Wide Web is often referred to as the Internet, the two are not the same thing. 
	The Internet is a huge network of networks that links computers together all over the world using a range of wires and wireless technologies.
	The World Wide Web is the collection of linked pages that are accessed using the Internet and a web browser. </p>
	<h2>History</h2><a name="History"></a>
	<p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist. 
	He was born in London, and his parents were early computer scientist, working on one of the earliest computers. 
	He graduated from Oxford University which resulted in him becoming a software engineer at CERN, the largest particle physics lab near Geneva, Switzerland.
	In March 1989, Tim planned out his vision for what would become the web in a document called”<em>Information Management: A Proposal</em>”.</p>

	<p>It wasn’t until Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989, that the Internet made its public debut. 
	The World Wide Web is a system of interlinked hypertext documents that are accessed via the internet.
	On Christmas day of 1990, Berners-Lee created the first successful communication between an HTTP client and a serve.
	Tim has written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s Web:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>HTML: HyperText Markup Language - The markup (formatting) language for the Web.</li>
		<li>URI: Uniform Resource Identifier - Its a string of characters used to identify the name of a resource. It is also commonly called a URL.</li>
		<li>HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol - Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the Web.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>From there he designed and built the first Web browser and it wasn’t until August 6th 1991 when the first Web page went live. 
	With a web browser, one can view web pages that may contain images, text, videos and other multimedia and navigate between them via hyperlinks.</p>
	<p>Tim moved from CERN to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1994 to found the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
	an international community where member organization work together to develop Web standards which is being led by Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee.</p>
	<h2>The Internet</h2><a name="The Internet"></a>
	<p>The internet is a worldwide computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities which are linked mostly by telephone lines.
	It is the hardware and software that provides connection between multiple computers. 
	The Web is one of many applications that can run on the internet. 
	The world internet comes from interconnected networks.</p>
	<h2>How Web Pages Are Delivered</h2><a name="How Web Pages Are Delivered"></a>
	<p>People use browsers like Internet Explorer, Google Chrome etc, for basic information but also for various other needs including online shopping and casual gaming.</p>
	<blockquote><em>Web servers supply content to the Web browsers via Internet network connections. Web browsers and Web servers together function as a client-server system.
	In computer networking, client-server is a standard method for designing applications where data is kept in central locations (server computers) Web browsers all function as clients that request information from Web sites (servers).</em></blockquote>
	<p>Web browsers also rely on DNS (Domain Name System) server is a large database containing each domain name and its corresponding IP address.</p>
	<h2>HTML</h2><a name="HTML"></a>
	<p>HTML also known as Hypertext Mark-up Language is  a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphic and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages. 
	It is a language used for describing the structural elements that appear on web documents (web pages).
	A mark-up language is a set of mark-up tags, which tells the web browser how to display the content (text and images) in a web page to the user.
	Each individual mark-up code is referred to as an element but many people refer to it as a tag. 
	Some tags come in pairs that indicate when a display effect is to begin and when it is to end.</p>
	<h2>The Future </h2><a name="The Future"></a>
	<p>The internet has gained access to almost every corner of society, transforming our lives in the process. 
	Networks have the ability to react to data’s context, not just the data itself. 
	Context can be determined by a combination of four data layers:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A device layer - Where devices communicate with one another.</li>
		<li>An individual layer - Information about browsing history, location history and online records.</li>
		<li>A social layer - Links people across social platforms.</li>
		<li>An environmental layer - Information about current conditions, such as nearby businesses, streets and weather.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Facebook has changed how we connect with other people in a different location, Uber has made it easier for us to get from one place to another. 
	But what about the future of the internet within the next couple of years. 
	In the next couple of years every corner of the world will be able to use the internet <em>as Googles executive chairman Eric Schmidt predicted in 2013.</em></p>
	<p>The way we access internet today is via devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets. 
	Whereas in the next couple of years our household products from controlling your house lights to using a washing machine will have internet connectivity and so on. 
	We’re living in a time where the internet will become the central control of everything electronic.</p>
