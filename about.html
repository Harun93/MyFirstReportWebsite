		<h2>About me</h3>		
		<p>My name is Harun Hussain I'm originally from Pakistan my nationality is British, I was born and raised in Riaydh which is located in Saudi Arabia.
		I completed my studies up to A Levels in Riyadh then moved to UK to study Information Technology and recently moved to Dublin to continue my education in Computing.
		I originally had a mind set of doing Aeroautial Engineering but later moved into the field of Computing as I persoanlly enjoyed that area of work.
		My preoccupation with sports has enabled me to lead an active and robust life outdoors, come to know fellow-friends, people of different walks of life and their attitudes, 
		and most of all socializing with other students, and officials at various levels. I enjoy playing alomost every sport but have a firm intrest in Cricket and Football.
		When it comes to professional sports the only two teams I follow are Pakistan for Cricket and Manchester United for football.</p>
